# Random-Trivia


This project displays random food trivia from Spoonacular.com. You can create your own list for: groceries, parties, and etc. I used fetch api with an api key to display the trivia. I created a form with a name and email input. I added a regex to accept lowercase and uppercase letters. I added a regex to must accept an @ sign for an email address. 

This Random Trivia Website can be viewed in browser by going to the terminal and typing http-server --proxy http://localhost:8080? in the command line and click the link.
