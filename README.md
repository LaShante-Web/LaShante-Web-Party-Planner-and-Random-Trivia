# Random-Trivia


This project is about planning a party for baby showers, gender reveals, weddings, birthday parties, shopping, and everyday todo lists. You can use this web application to create list items. In addition, a vistor could come to this web application to generate random trivia. One could provided there name and email to give feedback about the website. This web application is for interactivity. 


I created an array to display photos and information pertaining to weddings, baby showers, and birthdays. This project displays random food trivia from Spoonacular.com with fetch API. I used an API key to fetch the information.  I created a form with a name email, and textarea input. I used a regex to make sure the email contains an @ symbol. After the vistor hits the submit button the information is posted to formcarry.com
