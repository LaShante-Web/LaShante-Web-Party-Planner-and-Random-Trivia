# Random-Trivia


This project displays random food trivia from Spoonacular.com. A visitor could create their own list for: groceries, parties, and etc. This project displays pictures of a baby shower, wedding, and birthday party. Visitors could also submit feedback about the website. 


 I used fetch api with an api key to display the trivia. I created a form with a name and email input. I added a regex to make sure the @ symbol is the email. I created a function and populated it with 
multiple parameters to determine new values based on the inputs. I created a form and post the values to external API on formcarry.com

This Random Trivia Website can be viewed in browser by going to the terminal and typing http-server --proxy http://localhost:8080? in the command line and click the link.
